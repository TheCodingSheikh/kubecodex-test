# Kubecodex

Kubecodex is a standardized GitOps repository structure that works with ArgoCD to manage Kubernetes applications across multiple clusters. It provides:

- **Organized Structure**: Clear separation between cluster-specific and essential applications
- **Automated Discovery**: ApplicationSet controllers automatically discover and manage applications
- **Flexible Configuration**: Override defaults through simple config.yaml files
- **Multi-Project Support**: Logical grouping and access control through ArgoCD projects

## Setup

After cloning or creating from template, start by using the CLI:

```bash
./kubecodex setup
```

It'll prompt for:
- Repository URL
- ArgoCD namespace

Then you can apply the bootstrap manifests (Argo should already be installed)

```bash
./kubecodex bootstrap
```
or
```bash
kubectl apply -f bootstrap.yaml
```

That's it â€” your ArgoCD instance will start syncing resources from your GitOps repository!

To make ArgoCD manage itself, uncomment `resources` in bootstrap/argo-cd/kustomization.yaml
