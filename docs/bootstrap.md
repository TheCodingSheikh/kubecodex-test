# Bootstrap Directory

The `bootstrap/` directory contains the initial manifests for bootstrapping Argo CD and the ApplicationSet controllers, as well as the main ApplicationSet definitions that automate the discovery and management of applications and resources in the repository.

This directory is essential for setting up the GitOps workflow and should be applied first when setting up a new cluster.
